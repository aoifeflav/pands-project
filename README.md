### by Aoife Flavin

This repository contains my analysis of the Iris dataset. The purpose of this repoitory is for my final project in the module Programming and Scripting, in Semester 1 of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at ATU.

## About the Iris dataset
The Iris dataset is a very commonly used dataset in the world of data science. It has been called the "Hello World of data science. The data is also sometimes known as  Fisher's Iris data set, after the biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher used it in his who used it in his 1936 paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems'.

The data set has 50 samples of three different species of Iris; Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor.

The dataset contains five columns:
* sepal length
* sepal width
* petal length
* petal width
* species







### MVP Project plan
Get these tasks done by 12/05 and from there add extras
* ~~create repository~~
* Write a summary of the dataset in the readme
* ~~Download dataset & add to repository (done in Ian's lectures)~~
* Write a summary of each variable
* ~~have analysis.py output a summary of each variable to a single text file (extracting the result of pandas . describe() of each variable to a txt file.)~~ (Need to test)
* ~~Create a histrgram of sepal length~~
* ~~Create a histrgram of sepal width~~
* ~~Create a histrgram of petal length~~
* ~~Create a histrgram of petal width~~
* ~~Create a bar chart of flower type~~
* ~~Create a scatter plot of sepal length x width~~
* ~~Create a scater plot of petal length x width~~
* ~~Create a scater plot of petal length x sepal width~~
* ~~Create a scater plot of petal length x sepal length~~
* ~~Create a scatter plot of petal width x sepal width~~
* ~~Create a scatter plot of petal width x sepal length~~
* Convert these plots to seaborn, so they can be viewed together with the different species seperated by colour
